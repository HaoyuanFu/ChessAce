\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to re-implement the open source package ChessOOP. Large-scale video games are popular at present, but during the business days, most of the users, including students and employees, cannot enjoy such games with their insufficient fragmented time. Fortunately, people still have traditional board games like chess to utilize such spare time. Furthermore, chess can also help establish and enhance the relationship between different people. For example, two board game fans meet and choose to play chess during their study break. However, setting up the physical board and pieces usually depletes the limited time and the interest that appears occasionally. In this case, a portable, player versus player (PVP) chess program is needed to allow users to play it face to face anywhere anytime.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project is an external group who is acting as a evaluator and final viewer before its deployment. Such group of people may be interested in reverse-engineering or re-implement the project ChessAce in the later future.
\subsubsection{The Customers}
Consumers are individuals who will be interested in consuming the game content. The consumers, which members involve with all ages, who have the internet access to download the game, and the hardware support to interact with the game.
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Any other individuals, groups or organizations who have an interested in the game. Such entities mush have feasible tool to either interact with or investigate or modify the program following the software licensing.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Developer}: Members of MIF team are the developers for this project.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The program shall be implemented with Java language.
\item The program shall be able to download to and execute on any Windows, OS X and Linux OS with Java JDK.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
\begin{itemize}
\item The program shall be able to use any integrated PC display adapter to display graphic component.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
ChessAce does not have any direct partner or collaborative applications but does rely on Eclipse and some image editor to be implemented. It also relys on a personal computer supporting Java in order to execute.
\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
For the product to execute, the following off-the-shelf software is required:
\begin{itemize}
\item Java
\end{itemize}
Java is free-to-download from online resource.
\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The antocopated workplace environment is anywhere except extreme condition such as storm, rain or any other conditions that are capable of damaging the cooperating hardware.
\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
ChessAce must be completed with functional software and appropriate documentation in one university semester by December 8.
\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The budget is not applicable to this project, since we are using our own laptop to complete the code development. No addition resource is needed.
\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functional Requirements: Requirements that describes what the product will do
\item GUI: Graphical User Interface
\item ChessOOP: name of an open-source chess game program
\item Non-functional Requirements: Requirements that describe qualities that the product will have

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\subsubsection{Relevant Facts}
The application is intended for use by two users on their local machine. The length of the overall codes is approximately 1500 lines. The open-source project that the application is based upon has a very short revision history and part of documentation, and lacking a specific user manual.

\subsubsection{Business Rules}
The only rules we've established is that everyone should contribute approximately the same into the development, and members should try to take jobs if they feel they are stronger in certain areas.

\subsubsection{Assumption}
It will assume that the users will have general knowledge of computers. If the any advanced knowledge is needed, it  will be explained in a user manual. The developer has assumed that all the developing tool, such as IDE and image processing, etc, will be free. Also, the team has assumed that all the users are able to gain internet access in order to download the project.



X The open-source project that the application is based upon has a very short revision history and part of documentation, even lacking a specific user manual. This needs to be addressed in reimplementation. It will assume that the users only have basic general knowledge of computers. In order to use the application, any elements or features of the application whose operation requires more advanced knowledge will be explained in a user manual.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Automated Testing:
The ability to determine the correctness of the player's chess movement needs to be implemented to enable automated testing.
The ability to determine chess plate setting and checkmate (starting a game and ending game) needs to be implemented to enable automated testing.
\medskip \newline
Understanding code structure of existing open-source project:
The project that the application is based on has undocumented code with some unimplemented basic features, so analyzing its code structure is necessary to understand how the program functions.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
There are many currently available product that are similar to the application. We could find many existing online or offline chess video game online, such as chess with friends, chess titans, Sparkchess. These chess game are all similar to our project which could help us to understand the basic rules of chess and to implement our player versus player offline chess game.

\subsection{New Problems}
N/A ATM

\subsection{Tasks}
The project's task is set by the deliverable outline for Software Engineering 3XA3. The final demonstration and documentation will need to complete by December 5th, 2018. Deliverables include ProjectApproval, DevelopmentPlan, ProblemStatement, Requirements Document Revision 0, Proof of Concept Demonstration, Test Plan Reversion 0, Design and Document Revision 0, Revision 0 Demonstration, Final Demonstration Revision 1, Peer Evaluation of Oher Team Final Demo and Final Documentation Revision 1.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Requirements will be phased in over time in order of the priorities listed in this documentation, starting with High Priority requirements. The new product will be tested on three devices, running Windows 10, Linux, and Mac OS 10. The product should pass the current battery of automated unit testing as well.

\subsection{Risks}
One of the risks is that the project may crash because the player may do some misoperation such as move the chess pieces out of chess plate or did some movement which breaks the chess's role. These operations may cause the software crash which also means that the testing portion of the project will heavily rely on the user's operation and chess movements. The other risks may be a memory leak and make the whole system slowing down. This means the testing portion of the project will heavily rely on checking the memory state to make sure no stack overflow happens.

\subsection{Costs}
N/A ATM
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The product will contain a user manual which will include instructions on
how to use the application, the rules of chess movement and it will include details on all of its features
and options.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
The GUI needs to be improved and the functional and non-functional re-
quirements need to be implemented.
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
Using GUI development software could help improve the GUI.
